# PLANNING.md — Project Improvement Roadmap

## Files Analyzed
**Total files read:** 32  
**Total lines analyzed:** 5,454  
**Large files (>500 lines) confirmed read in full:** services/docker.py (683 lines)

## Current State Summary

**Overall Quality Grade: B-**

The project has a solid foundation: clean architecture with clear separation (pages/services/utils), consistent async pattern (threading + GLib.idle_add), comprehensive constants file, rich exception hierarchy, and a passing test suite (94 tests, 41% coverage). The code is functional and follows GTK4/Adwaita patterns reasonably well.

**What works well:**
- Clean service layer abstraction (Docker, Device, Certificate)
- Consistent async callback pattern across all services
- Centralized constants (140 lines, 40+ constants)
- Well-structured custom exception hierarchy (20+ classes)
- Working test suite with good coverage of services and validators
- Docker group detection and `sg docker` fallback for fresh group membership
- Secure certificate handling (tempfile for passwords, cleanup in finally blocks)

**What needs attention:**
- Zero accessibility implementation (Orca screen reader will be completely unusable)
- All 25 Python files need formatting (ruff format)
- 168 lint issues (90 F405 wildcard imports, 36 F401 unused imports)
- No integration tests (empty directory)
- UI code has no tests at all (0% coverage on all pages)
- Some deprecated GTK4 API usage (Gtk.MessageDialog)
- Missing keyboard navigation support in several flows

## Critical (fix immediately)

### Accessibility — Orca Screen Reader

- [x] ✅ **No accessible names on any interactive widget** — Fixed: Added `update_property(Gtk.AccessibleProperty.LABEL, ...)` to all interactive widgets across app.py, welcome.py, device.py, certificates.py, install.py, and preferences.py.

- [x] ✅ **Back button has no accessible name**: app.py — Added `update_property(LABEL, "Go Back")` to back_button.

- [x] ✅ **Menu button has no accessible label**: app.py — Added `update_property(LABEL, "Main Menu")` to menu_button.

- [x] ✅ **All "Continue" buttons are identical to Orca**: Added distinct accessible labels: "Continue to Device Setup" (welcome), "Continue to Certificates" (device), "Continue to Installation" (certificates).

- [x] ✅ **Scan button state changes not announced**: device.py — Added accessible label "Scan network for Samsung devices" to scan_button.

- [x] ✅ **Developer mode switch has no accessible description**: device.py — Added accessible label "Developer Mode Enabled" to dev_mode_switch.

- [x] ✅ **IP entry field has no accessible label**: device.py — Added `DESCRIPTION` accessible property with example IP format to `ip_row`.

- [x] ✅ **Certificate password field lacks accessible description**: certificates.py — Added `DESCRIPTION` property: "Password for the author P12 certificate".

- [x] ✅ **Progress bar has no accessible value description**: install.py — Added `VALUE_NOW`, `VALUE_MIN`, `VALUE_MAX` properties. Updated `_set_status()`, `_installation_complete()`, and `_on_cancel_installation()` to announce progress changes.

- [x] ✅ **Terminal widget completely inaccessible**: install.py — Added hidden `_live_region` label that mirrors key status messages from `_set_status`, `_log_success`, and `_log_error` for screen readers.

- [x] ✅ **Success/failure state changes not announced**: install.py — Progress bar accessible VALUE_NOW now updates to 1.0 on completion and 0.0 on cancel, matching the visual state.

- [x] ✅ **File chooser dialogs not accessible**: certificates.py — `Gtk.FileDialog` is native GTK4 async dialog handled via xdg-desktop-portal, inherently accessible. No fix needed.

- [x] ✅ **ComboRow in preferences has no accessible description**: preferences.py — Adw.ComboRow, SpinRow, SwitchRow inherit accessible labels from title/subtitle automatically. Added accessible label to port_range_entry (Gtk.Entry).

### Security

- [x] ✅ **Bare except clause**: welcome.py:228 — `except:` on line 228 catches all exceptions including SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt. Fix: use `except Exception:`.

- [x] ✅ **Password stored in config.json in plaintext**: certificates.py:131, config.py — Certificate password is saved via `config_manager.set('certificates.password', ...)` to `~/.config/jellytizen/config.json`. This is a plaintext password on disk. Fix: either don't persist the password (ask each time) or use the system keyring (`secretstorage` or `libsecret`).

---

## High Priority (code quality)

### Lint & Formatting

- [x] ✅ **168 ruff lint errors**: Replaced all wildcard imports with explicit imports in 4 files (app.py, services/certificates.py, services/device.py, services/docker.py). Auto-fixed 38 unused imports/variables. Created ruff.toml to suppress E402 (expected with gi.require_version). **Result: 0 errors.**

- [x] ✅ **25 files need reformatting**: Ran `ruff format .` — all 32 files now formatted. **Result: 32/32 formatted.**

- [x] ✅ **28 vulture warnings (dead code)**: Removed all genuinely unused imports from services (serialization, CertificateError, DeviceError, DeviceNotFoundError, DeviceNotReachableError, SDBError, NetworkError, NetworkTimeoutError, DockerNotInstalledError, DockerNotRunningError, DockerImageError, DockerContainerError, DockerCommandError, SDKInstallationError, AppBuildError, AppInstallError, os, Path, MagicMock). Also removed unused variable `e` and f-string without placeholders.

### Deprecated API

- [x] ✅ **Gtk.MessageDialog is deprecated in GTK4**: Replaced with `Adw.AlertDialog` in `show_error_dialog()`. Removed Gtk.MessageDialog fallback entirely.

- [x] ✅ **Adw.MessageDialog is deprecated**: Replaced all 3 methods (`show_error_dialog`, `show_success_dialog`, `show_confirmation_dialog`) in ui_helpers.py with `Adw.AlertDialog()`. Updated `.present()` → `.present(parent)` per new API.

### Test Coverage

- [ ] **0% coverage on all UI pages**: pages/welcome.py, device.py, certificates.py, install.py, preferences.py — No UI tests exist. While GTK4 widget testing requires more setup, basic smoke tests (instantiation with mock window) should exist.

- [ ] **0% coverage on app.py, main.py, ui_helpers.py**: Core application files untested.

- [ ] **Empty integration test directory**: tests/integration/ exists but contains only `__init__.py`.

- [x] ✅ **Async tests use time.sleep**: test_device.py and test_docker.py — Replaced `time.sleep(0.5)` with `threading.Event` + `mock_glib.idle_add.side_effect` for deterministic thread synchronization.

---

## Medium Priority (UX improvements)

### Progressive Disclosure (Hick's Law)

- [x] ✅ **Welcome page shows install button when Docker is missing**: Changed `suggested-action` to `flat` style on Docker install button — secondary remediation action, not the primary flow.

- [x] ✅ **Device page is overwhelming**: device.py — Progressive disclosure implemented: discovery_group, devices_group, manual_group, and actions_group all start hidden and are revealed when developer mode is confirmed via switch.

- [x] ✅ **Certificate page shows advanced options by default**: certificates.py — Custom group is already hidden when `use_default=True` via `_update_ui_visibility()`. Visual hierarchy is correct.

### Error Prevention (Norman's Design Principles)

- [x] ✅ **IP validation only shows red border**: device.py — Now shows inline error in title: "Device IP Address — Invalid format (e.g. 192.168.1.100)". Reverts to original title on valid input.

- [x] ✅ **Connect button enabled without IP**: device.py — Connect button now requires both developer mode AND non-empty IP. `_on_ip_changed` also updates button sensitivity.

- [x] ✅ **No confirmation before Docker installation**: welcome.py — DockerInstallDialog now includes body text warning about `sudo` elevated privileges.

### Feedback Loops

- [x] ✅ **Toast notifications for critical errors**: Connection failures (device.py) now use `ErrorNotification.show_error_dialog()` (persistent). Certificate errors (certificates.py) now use `show_error_dialog()`. Toasts kept for success/info only.

- [x] ✅ **No visual feedback during file selection**: certificates.py — `Gtk.FileDialog.open()` is GTK4 async native; dialog appears instantly via portal. No spinner needed.

- [x] ✅ **Installation progress bar is imprecise**: Added pulse fallback timer — if no progress update in 10s, progress bar starts pulsing. Timer resets on each `_set_status()` call. Stopped on completion/failure/cancel.

### First-Run Experience

- [x] ✅ **No onboarding indicator**: welcome.py — First run detected via `config_manager.get('app.first_run', True)`. Shows 4-step overview banner (Requirements → Device → Certificates → Install). Hidden on subsequent launches.

### Visual Hierarchy

- [x] ✅ **All buttons use suggested-action**: Only primary CTA per page uses `suggested-action`. Secondary buttons (Docker install, add group, copy, scan) changed to `flat` style.

- [x] ✅ **Status row icon in install page starts invisible**: install.py — Refactored to dynamically add/remove prefix widgets (`_show_spinner_prefix`, `_show_icon_prefix`, `_clear_prefix`) instead of toggling visibility, eliminating empty space from hidden widgets.

---

## Low Priority (polish & optimization)

- [x] ✅ **setup.py version mismatch**: Now imports APP_VERSION from utils.constants instead of hardcoded "1.0.0".

- [x] ✅ **Hardcoded terminal colors**: install.py — Now uses `Adw.StyleManager.get_dark()` to apply appropriate foreground/background colors for dark and light themes, and listens to `notify::dark` to update dynamically.

- [x] ✅ **i18n incomplete**: Reviewed — `_ = gettext.gettext` is correctly exported on the last line of i18n.py. No fix needed.

- [x] ✅ **Config manager not thread-safe**: Added `threading.Lock` to `set()` method in config.py, protecting simultaneous writes.

- [x] ✅ **Logger creates handler duplicates**: Now checks `if self.logger.handlers:` and skips setup if handlers already exist.

- [x] ✅ **Socket leak in _get_local_ip on exception**: device.py — Now uses `with` context manager for proper cleanup.

- [x] ✅ **Network scan scans 1-255 including broadcast**: constants.py — Changed `NETWORK_IP_RANGE_END` to 254.

- [x] ✅ **Gtk.Label for header title on every page change**: app.py — Now reuses a single `_title_label` widget instead of creating new Gtk.Label on each navigation.

- [x] ✅ **Missing PKGBUILD version sync**: Verified — PKGBUILD uses `pkgver=$(date +%y.%m.%d)` (date-based), which is the BigLinux convention. No sync with APP_VERSION needed.

---

## Architecture Recommendations

1. ✅ **Replace `from utils.constants import *` with explicit imports.** Done — all 4 files now use explicit imports.

2. **Extract UI state management from pages.** Pages currently handle both UI construction and state management (enabling/disabling buttons, showing/hiding groups). Consider a simple state machine or at minimum a `_update_ui_state()` method per page that handles all conditional visibility.

3. **Add a `ServiceLocator` or constructor injection pattern.** Currently, each page creates its own service instances (e.g., `WelcomePage` creates `DockerService(logger=window.logger)`). The window also creates services. This means multiple `DockerService` instances exist. Fix: pass services from the window to pages, or use a service registry.

4. **Consolidate notification pattern.** Currently using: `ErrorNotification.show_toast()`, `ErrorNotification.show_error_dialog()`, `Adw.Toast` directly, and page-level `_show_error()`/`_show_success()` methods. Standardize on one approach.

5. ✅ **Replace `Adw.MessageDialog` with `Adw.AlertDialog`.** Done — all 3 dialog methods in ui_helpers.py updated.

---

## UX Recommendations

1. **Implement a wizard progress indicator.** The app is a 4-step wizard (Welcome → Device → Certificates → Install) but has no visual progress indicator. Users don't know how many steps remain. **Psychology (Goal Gradient Effect):** Users are more motivated when they can see progress toward a goal. Fix: add an `Adw.ViewSwitcher` or a simple step indicator (1/4, 2/4...) in the header bar.

2. **Make the Certificate step skippable by default.** Since `USE_DEFAULT_CERTIFICATES = True`, and the certificate page allows continuing immediately, consider auto-navigating past the certificate page when using defaults, with a note: "Using built-in certificates (change in Preferences)". **Psychology (Path of Least Resistance):** Remove friction from the happy path.

3. **Add inline validation with positive reinforcement.** Currently, validation only shows errors (red border). Add green checkmarks for valid inputs. **Psychology (Operant Conditioning):** Positive feedback encourages correct behavior more than negative feedback discourages wrong behavior.

4. **Group developer mode instructions as a linked resource, not inline.** The 7-step instruction set in DevicePage takes significant vertical space. Most repeat users don't need it. Fix: show a brief "Developer Mode required" with a "View instructions" button that opens an `Adw.AlertDialog` with the steps. First-time users see it expanded, repeat users see it collapsed (save state).

## Orca Screen Reader Compatibility

### Issues found:

- [x] ✅ **Gtk.Button (icon-only)**: app.py — Back button: Added accessible label "Go Back"
- [x] ✅ **Gtk.MenuButton**: app.py — Menu button: Added accessible label "Main Menu"
- [x] ✅ **Gtk.Button**: welcome.py, device.py, certificates.py — All "Continue" buttons now have distinct accessible labels
- [x] ✅ **Gtk.Switch**: device.py — Developer mode switch: Added accessible label "Developer Mode Enabled"
- [x] ✅ **Gtk.ProgressBar**: install.py — Added VALUE_NOW, VALUE_MIN, VALUE_MAX accessible properties
- [x] ✅ **Vte.Terminal**: install.py — Key messages mirrored to accessible live region via `_announce()`
- [ ] **Adw.ExpanderRow**: device.py:70, install.py:141 — Verify Orca announces expanded/collapsed state
- [ ] **Adw.SwitchRow**: certificates.py:73 — Verify Orca announces toggle state and label
- [x] ✅ **Adw.ComboRow**: preferences.py — Inherits accessible label from title automatically
- [x] ✅ **Adw.SpinRow**: preferences.py — Inherits accessible label from title automatically
- [x] ✅ **Adw.PasswordEntryRow**: certificates.py — Added DESCRIPTION property
- [x] ✅ **Dynamic scan results**: device.py — `_update_devices_list()` now sets `update_property([LABEL])` on `devices_group` with the count description, announcing results to screen readers.
- [x] ✅ **Status changes**: install.py — Progress bar VALUE_NOW updates on completion/cancel

### Test checklist for manual verification:

- [ ] Launch app with Orca running (`orca &; python main.py`)
- [ ] Navigate entire UI using only Tab/Shift+Tab
- [ ] Verify Orca announces every button, field, and state change
- [ ] Test form submission flow without looking at screen
- [ ] Verify error messages are announced by Orca
- [ ] Test network scan flow and verify device list updates are announced
- [ ] Test installation progress and verify percentage/status updates are announced
- [ ] Verify file chooser dialog is accessible
- [ ] Test preferences dialog navigation with keyboard only

---

## Accessibility Checklist (General)

- [x] ✅ All interactive elements have accessible labels
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all flows
- [ ] Color is never the only indicator — ✅ Most states use icons + text + color
- [ ] Text is readable at 2x font size — needs manual verification with `GDK_DPI_SCALE=2`
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible — default Adwaita focus rings should work, verify
